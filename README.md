# Wealthfront 
I opened my first small taxable account at Wealthfront April 2017 as an experiment to see how well the RoboAdvisor worked to automate my investments. The portfolios were designed by a financial board of which Burton Malkiel, whom I respect, is a member still. Six months later I was satisfied that the RoboAdvisor met my needs. I automated monthly deposits the Taxable account and opened and fully funded two Roth IRA's and two 529's.

## Investment Policies
***April 2023 except where a date prefix is shown for later adjustments...***

- I subscribe to the efficient markets theory and so invest broadly to capture the market returns.
- I reinvest all dividends for portfolio re-balancing and to maximize total returns.
- I am using dollar cost averaging of fixed dollar amounts during the accumulation phase.
- I am primarily using broad market ETFs to invest because of the many efficiencies.
- I use Wealthfront's direct indexing advanced tax loss harvesting methodology in taxable accounts to capture losses for use in offsetting future gains.
- I use Wealthfront's continuous ETF based tax loss harvesting methodology in taxable accounts to capture losses for use in offsetting future gains.
- I use Wealthfront's continuous portfolio re-balancing methodology to buy low and sell high.
- I am performing a three year evaluation of Wealthfront's Risk Parity Fund in my taxable account as an alternative investment. ** 4/2/2021 Change: After three year experiment decided to liquidate stake in WFRPX.**
- I am invested in Municiple Bond ETFs in my taxable account to reduce my PA state income tax.
- I am invested in US broad equities across all accounts for growth to outpace inflation.
- I am invested in high grade US mid term Corporate bonds as a hedge against market volatility extremes.
- I subscribe to a belief that the world economies and markets will also remain a good place to invest for diversity of assets.
- I am invested in foreign developed equities and bonds as a diversification strategy.
- I subscribe to a belief that the emerging markets support a growing middle class in those countries and thus will continue to grow over the long term.
- I am invested in foreign emerging market equities and bonds as a diversification strategy assuming higher risk/reward.
- Should the investments in any account be down more than 15-20% use Cash account withdrawal for that month to avoid sequence of return risk. Continue until investments return to less than 5-10% down. ** 1/15/2026 Change: Use Guyton-Klinger automated decision tool to suggest withdrawal locations based on codified logic.**
- Use reverse dollar cost averaging to withdraw a standard monthly percentage of assets from investment accounts and use cash to make up the difference when markets are in distress. This is my current withdrawal plan, I am researching other strategies.
- Current Lead Case: Guyton-Klinger Monthly Inflation Adjusted Withdrawals for retirement as modeled in Guyton-Klinger Monthly Withdrawal Simulator.xlsx.
- Modeling Roth conversions affect on taxation in NewRetirement planning tool. ** 4/1/2024 Change: Began using TaxLab module in IncomeLab to perform all Tax Planning and projections.**
- **August 2023 :** Began using IncomeLab to plan and project Roth conversions.
